# Campsite Availability Scraping

**This has been updated to work with the new recreation.gov site and API!!!**

This script scrapes the https://recreation.gov website for campsite availabilities.

**Note:** Please don't abuse this script. Most folks out there don't know how to run scrapers against websites, so you're at an unfair advantage by using this.
